        "Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or object. This hides the internal workings of objects and protects data from unintended interference.\n",

        "Inheritance: Allowing one class to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of another. This promotes code reuse and hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
